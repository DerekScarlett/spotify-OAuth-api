How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ajax, JQuery

I stated off by adding a h2 tag and a h3 tag to be able to place the users who the acocount belongs to and the users account type. I aso added to button to be able to access the api and the api end point for the user. in the javascript I made a click function that redirects you to the api that allows the user to access their acount. Then after the Userlogins in they are redirected back to the origional host. The next click function that takes the response from the api and appends it to the DOM.

Lessons Learned:
No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those whoa this is awesome or fuck yeah I did it! moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
